# Smart Grocery & Meal Planner — Project Brief (MVP)
**Goal:** A small, working class MVP that helps students, professionals, and families track pantry items, see expiring/low stock items, get AI meal ideas from what they have, and turn missing ingredients into a grocery list.

**Scope (MVP):**
- Manage Inventory (CRUD pantry items, low/expiring flags)
- Suggest Meals (AI ideas using pantry + preferences)
- Build Grocery List (add missing/low items)
- Notifications (basic scheduled reminders)

**Non-Goals (MVP):**
- Full recipe DB, advanced nutrition, social sharing, payments

**Why this will work:** We already completed Systems Request, Feasibility, Requirements, Event–Response, Use Cases, DFDs, Structure Charts, Physical ERD + SQL, and Program Specs. These will drive AI-assisted code generation with minimal tools.
